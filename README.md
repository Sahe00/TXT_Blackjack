Just as the name implies, a simple text-based blackjack I did a while back on my free time.

Description:
Once the code is run, the interaction with the application is done by text in the console window. 

Once welcomed to the menu screen of sort, you can choose to either start a new game (1) or exit out of the game (2). The selection is done by entering the corresponding number in the console window (1-2).

If a new game is started you will be dealt two random cards from all the possible 4 suits of 13 different ranks. What is in your hand is indicated by the text "Your hand:" preceeding the cards. The total of the cards in your hand will also be calculated for your convenience, and this is the case even after possibly receiving more cards.
The dealer will receive two completely random cards as well. However, the second card will be facing down and will be unknown for the moment, indicated by the "<face down>" text. Dealers hand will be indicated by the text "Dealer hand:" preceeding the two cards.

You will then be asked whether you'd like to "hit" or "stand". To give your desired answer you need to enter either answer in the console. If "hit" is chosen, another card will be displayed at the end of "Your hand:". If stand is chosen the remaining card of the dealer facing down "<face down>" will be revealed.

I won't delve into the details of blackjack rules, as there are better explanations available on the internet. :)
